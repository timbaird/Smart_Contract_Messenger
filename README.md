# Smart_Contract_Messenger

Messing around with Solidity while working through this udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/master-ethereum-and-solidity-programming-with-real-world-apps/

This contract provides a clandestine / dead drop message service for sneaky people.

It would obviously cost some ETH if running on mainnet, but could equally well serve its purpose for free (and be less liekly to attract scrutiny) running one one of the many testnets around, so long as the two parties involved knew which test network they were on, the contract address and had access to their respective wallets / addresses they could communicate in a way that would be difficult to detect or intercept.
